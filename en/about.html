    <h3>What problem does PasswordZ solve?</h3>
    <p class="lead">
        Have you ever had any of the following concerns?
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Too many passwords to remember? How to remember the passwords of so many websites, apps, and bank cards?</li>
        <li>A password to go all over the world? What happens when a website's password is compromised? All websites, apps, and bank cards must be changed with passwords!</li>
        <li>Password rules are different? Website A must contain alphanumeric characters, website B cannot use characters, and website C can only contain 8 digits. If you don't remember the rules, you can only find them again and again, and then forget them again and again!</li>
        <li>Password management tools? What should I do if I don't have a computer, I borrow someone else's device temporarily, and I can't use a password manager?</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>PasswordZ's solution</h4>
    <p></p>
    <h5>
        Remember one original password and you can have an infinite number of independent distribution passwords.
    </h5>
    <p>
        Use the original password and different scenarios to generate different distribution passwords, only need to remember one original password, with the help of the PasswordZ, each website, APP, bank card has an independent and unrelated password.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Password generation algorithms are unidirectional and irreversible
    </h5>
    <p>
        The password generation algorithm is irreversible, and the combination of scene code and password character encryption factor is superimposed, so even if the password of a certain website is leaked, the original password cannot be calculated based on the password.
    </p>
    <h5>Strong passwords</h5>
    <p>
       Use a combination of 16-digit numeric uppercase and lowercase letters, special characters, to increase password strength.
    </p>
    <h5>Adapt to different password rules for different sites</h5>
    <p>
        You can customize password rules and generate passwords according to your own security requirements and scenario password requirements.
    </p>
    <h5>High availability anytime, anywhere</h5>
    <p>
        Provide a variety of operating system distributions, browser extensions, online services, etc., there are at least two programs available on any terminal, so that they can be used by any terminal, anytime, anywhere.
    </p>

    <h3>Is it safe to hand over the password to the management of PasswordZ?</h3>
    <p></p>
    <h5>Traceless use, stateless and sessionless, no storage, so it won't be leaked</h5>
    <p>
        PasswordZ are stateless, no sessions, no server-side storage, and no local storage, and the use of PasswordZ will not leave any traces locally or on the network, eliminating the problem of password leakage from the root.
    </p>
    <h5>Local computing, so it won't be stolen</h5>
    <p>
        PasswordZ uses completely local computing (the online version uses a browser to calculate), and there is no access to the local disk or network during the calculation, so there is no possibility that the password will be stolen by a third party.
    </p>
    <h5>The algorithm is open source, so it won't be lost</h5>
    <p>
        The PasswordZ algorithm is open source, and the underlying encryption algorithm is also open source algorithm, and the official provides various types of software such as online version, offline version, browser plug-in version, etc., and there is no situation where the password algorithm cannot be used or lost.
